<h2>
Forest Village
</h2>
<p>
To your surprise this island is not uninhabited, you have found a small village with a couple dozen people living in tiny houses made from what looks like boards from old wrecked ships. They seem to have been expecting you and would be willing to share some of the lore of this island as well as its purpose.
